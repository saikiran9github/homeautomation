Home Automation System
This project is a home automation system that uses various IoT sensors to automate and monitor aspects of the home environment, like security, lighting, and temperature control. The system is built around a Raspberry Pi or Arduino with sensors like PIR, Clap (KY-038), DHT11, and relays for controlling devices.

Description
This home automation system utilizes IoT sensors and a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi/Arduino) to automate the home environment. The system includes motion detection, sound detection, temperature and humidity monitoring, and the ability to control devices through relays based on sensor data.

Features:
PIR Motion Sensor (SR505) for detecting movement.

KY-038 Clap Sensor for detecting claps and triggering actions.

DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor for monitoring room temperature and humidity.

Relay Module to control appliances like fans, lights, etc.

Integration with MQTT Broker for communication between devices.

Prerequisites
Hardware:
Raspberry Pi or Arduino (Depending on your choice of platform)

PIR Sensor (SR505) for motion detection.

KY-038 Clap Sensor to detect claps.

DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor.

Relay Module to control devices.

Jumper wires, Breadboard, etc.

Software:
Arduino IDE (if using Arduino) or PlatformIO (if using Raspberry Pi).

MQTT Broker (Configured at IP: 192.168.0.110 for communication).

Installation
Clone the repository:



For Arduino:

Install the necessary libraries like PubSubClient for MQTT and DHT for temperature & humidity reading.

For Raspberry Pi, install MQTT-related libraries and the necessary sensor drivers.


Set up the MQTT Broker:

Make sure your MQTT broker is running at the IP 192.168.0.110. You can use a Raspberry Pi or a dedicated MQTT broker like Mosquitto for this.

Wiring:
Follow the wiring diagram for connecting the sensors and relay to the microcontroller.

Wiring Diagram
Below is a simple schematic for how the sensors and relay should be connected to your microcontroller (Raspberry Pi or Arduino):

PIR Sensor: Connected to GPIO pin 4.

KY-038 Clap Sensor: Connected to GPIO pin 17.

DHT11: Connected to GPIO pin 22.

Relay: Connected to GPIO pin 27.


Usage
Upload the code to your microcontroller:

If you're using Arduino, upload the .ino file.

If you're using Raspberry Pi, upload the Python or C code.

Run the system:

The system will automatically monitor sensors and trigger actions based on motion, sound, and environmental changes.

You can control the connected devices (like lights or fans) via the relay by sending commands through the MQTT broker.

Control via MQTT:

Subscribe to topics on the MQTT broker to receive sensor data and control actions.
